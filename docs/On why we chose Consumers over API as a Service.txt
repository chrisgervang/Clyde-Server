On why we chose Consumers over API as a Service:

Our vision is to facilitate great experiences for real people. While we know we could deliver a great product to developers, we are not as confidant that those developers would be able to devliver great experiences to the end customer yet. 

The space is not yet saturated with users to motivate developers to build business off of a home automation platform. [Similar to the release of the iPhone, we see the value of developer apps once we build a user base]

Furthermore, while there is a decent amount of home automation hardware on the market today, we feel there isnâ€™t enough yet to enable our developers to create a diverse selection of apps. 

Lastly, we both have strong skills and experience around creating products for consumers, it would be irresponsible to the company for us to not utilize them.
