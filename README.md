Raspberry Pi "Paperboy" Node Server
===================================

This will NOT be pulled back into the main backend. It's a temporary solution to bridgeing local network Smart Devices with Clyde servers.

As such, this is very stripped down. It only contains Shouter's and a couple RESTful commands to command a house.

Devices
=======

- Philips Hue
- Insteon
- WeMo
